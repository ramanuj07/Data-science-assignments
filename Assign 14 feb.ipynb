    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resources,such as a lock or a semaphore,that they need to continue execution.\n",
    "In other words,each thread is blocked and waiting for a resource that another thread is holding, and the program becomes stuck in a state where no progress can be made.Deadlocks are serious problem in multithreaded programs and can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",

    "A race condition occurs when two threads access a shared variable at the same time. The first thread reads the variable, and the second thread reads the same value from the variable. Then the first thread and second thread perform their operations on the value, and they race to see which thread can write the value last to the shared variable. The value of the thread that writes its value last is preserved, because the thread is writing over the value that the previous thread wrote.\n",
