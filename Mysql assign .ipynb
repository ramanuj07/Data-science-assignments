    "# 1.What is a database? differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "# Ans-\n",
    "#     A database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed,managed,and updated.Databases are used to store and organize data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and manipulate the information they contain.There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# SQL databases,also known as relational databases,store data in tables with predefined columns and rows.They use a structured query languages(SQL) to interact with the data.SQL databases are best suited for applications where the data has a well-defined structure,such as financial applications .Examples of SQL databases include MySQL,PostgresSQL,Oracle,and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# NoSQL databases,do not use tables with predefined columns and rows.They store data in a variety of ways,such as key-value pairs,documents-oriented databases,and graph databases.NoSQL databases are best suited for applications where the data is unstructured or semi-structured,such as social media,big data,and real-time analytics.\n",
    "# Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB,Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# NoSQL databases are better suited for real-time applications,SQL databases also typically have better support for transactions and data integrity,While NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable.\n",
    "# The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of the application and data being stored.\n",
